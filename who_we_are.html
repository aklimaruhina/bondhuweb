                    </h6>

                    <p>
                        In December 2005 GIZ started the promotion of improved cookstoves (ICS) of clay developed by IFRD of BCSIR. The major focus of the GIZ intervention was on the establishment of a self-sustaining supply chain for stoves; this included massive training of stove builders (more than 10,000 persons were trained). Dissemination of the improved stove was quite rapid but monitoring showed that the quality of the stoves was not always according to design. In 2010 to overcome the quality problem GIZ introduced concrete as the material for manufacturing ICS. This allowed mass production and significantly better adherence to quality standards. Now GIZ supported all stoves are made by its partners with concrete. In 2012-2014 to expedite the penetration of Bondhu Chula, BCCT and GIZ undertook the joint project &quot;Market Development Initiative for Bondhu Chula.&quot; The aim of the project was to create 5000 entrepreneurs, who will produce, sell and install Bondhu Chula as a part of their business. The project was successfully implemented jointly by DoE and GIZ and completed on 31 March 2014. After the establishment of BONDHU, BCCT approved the second phase of the project ‘Market Development Initiative for Bondhu Chula’. Under this new phase, 400,000 Bondhu Chulas are expected to be installed in the period 01 July 2015-31 December 2016. This project is also being implemented jointly by DoE and GIZ (through BONDHU). Now Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation (BONDHU) is implementing the Bondhu Chula Project by the entrepreneurs who are supported by the Republic of Korea all over the country. The local Government is directly cooperating for implementing the project.
