                        <p class="mt-0 text-start pe-3 rdmore" id="content1">Bondhu Chula is a fuel-efficient, health, environment, and climate-friendly stove. The Bondhu Chula plays a friend-like role in protecting the environment of the family, the country, and the world. Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation (BONDHU) is conducting Bondhu Chula activities across the country. These activities are part of the development program of the Government of Bangladesh and are instrumental in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The local government, especially the Union Parishad is playing an important role in implementing these activities. The local entrepreneurs manufacture and sell the stove and the Bondhu Chula doctors provide the stove installation and after-sales service. Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation (BONDHU) is providing one Bondhu Chula per family at a subsidized price. The Bondhu Chula can be used for at least five years with proper maintenance. The disadvantages of using conventional stoves are - (i) Fuel is wasted. Cooking in the country consumes about 1.5 billion maunds of fuel every year; (ii) Risky for the health of everyone in the family, including conventional stove users; (iii) There are various diseases caused by smoke, such as asthma, headache, cancer, eye irritation. As a result, millions of women and children die prematurely in Bangladesh every year; (iv)The kitchen is soaked; The pots and pans become dirty; (v)Kitchen tin spoils faster; (vi) It takes more time to collect fuel; (vii) Excessive cutting down of trees is causing deforestation and losing the balance of the environment; (viii) The risk of climate change is increasing as more carbon dioxide is emitted, resulting in various natural disasters such as excessive rainfall, drought, flood, etc. The advantages of using a Bondhu stove are - (i) Proper use saves more than 50% of fuel; (ii) The kitchen is smoke and pollution-free; (iii) Kitchen tin spoils less; (iv) It takes less time to collect fuel; (v) The kitchen is not soot with ink, the pots and pans are less dirty; (vi) Reducing deforestation gives the forest a chance to become a real forest. The use of a Bondhu Chula (Improved Cook Stove) emits at least 1.5 tons less carbon dioxide per year. This reduces the risk of climate change.</p>

                        <h5 ><b>AGRICULTURE</b></h5>
                        <p class="mt-0 pe-3 text-start rdmore" id="content2">Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation (BONDHU) is working to prevent climate change. Hence, this organization has undertaken the following two climate-friendly agriculture projects. Food security is at risk as agricultural production is endangered to prevent impending climate change. Bangladesh is one of the countries in the world that is at risk of climate change. In this situation, BONDHU has undertaken two projects. 1. Agriculture 2. Periodic wetting and drying methods. 1. Agriculture: At present, a large number of chemical fertilizers are used for higher production on the land. However, the widespread use of these chemical fertilizers adversely affects the soil, as well as reduces the amount of organic matter and beneficial microorganisms in the soil. In addition, the level of nutrient production in the land gradually decreases. For this, it is essential to use organic manure in the land. In addition, agricultural production is being hampered by increased carbon emissions due to increased deforestation and the growth of industrial plants and the overuse of groundwater is causing climate change. Importance of Organic Fertilizer: (i) Organic fertilizer is the lifeblood of the soil. (ii) Improves soil texture, increases aeration in the soil and increases soil water holding capacity. (iii) The use of organic fertilizers requires 15-20 percent fewer chemical fertilizers which play a role in preventing climate change. (iv) 10-15 kg earthworm manure percent should be used in the land. Green Fertilizer: Green manure is the fertilizer that is made when all the crops are mixed with the soil in green conditions. Pulses, Dhaincha, Jute can be easily mixed with soil to make green manure. Production of green manure for at least three consecutive years increases the fertility of the land. Method of making green manure: (i) Pulses, Dhaincha, Shanpat seeds should be cultivated 1-2 times in 6-7 kg per bigha of land and sprinkled well. (ii) Then within 50-60 days of seed germination when the tree flowers, the tree should be cut down and watered well and mixed well with the soil. (iii) In this way we can make green manure. Safe food and food security: Food is one of the main components of basic human needs. That food needs to be as nutritious as it needs to be safe. The need for food starts from the birth of a baby. Because only safe and nutritious food can turn human society into an intelligent nation. Achieving safe food by ensuring food security and balanced nutrition is a prerequisite for building a healthy and strong nation. Unintentional hazards include unwanted use of pesticides, herbicides, and cleaning chemicals. Intentional hazards include various types of unauthorized food additives such as food preservatives, pigments, perfumes, etc. There is no substitute for safe food management to protect life and health by protecting food from various hazards. In order to implement eco-friendly agriculture, special importance should be given to organic farming. What are organic pesticides? Organic sources especially pesticides derived from plants/plant parts are called organic pesticides. The use of chemical pesticides destroys the fertility of the land and also increases the cost. It is possible to change this condition by making pesticides using organic ingredients. Insects can be controlled by using various traps without using chemical pesticides.</p>

Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction. Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation (BONDHU) jointly with VNV Advisory Services is implementing a Gold Standard project activity.
                             The project aims to provide safe and clean drinking water to vulnerable rural coastal communities of Bangladesh by offering retrofit non-operational solar water filtration systems/plants set up by the government in different coastal regions. The project is intended to register with the Gold Standard for Global Goals to claim the emission reductions.</p>

Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation (BONDHU) implemented the project. Under the project, there are 14 Upazilas of 8 districts of Bangladesh- Charfassion, Bhandaria, Dashmina, Galachipa, Hatibandha, Patgram, Biswamvarpur, Tahirpur, Sonagazi, Debhata, Tala, Shyamnagar, Koyra and Dacope. 20,660 solar lamp sets were distributed among the students. In each set of light, there are two lamps- one main lamp (200 lumens) and an additional lamp (50 lumens). Moreover, all types of mobile phones can be charged from the main light through a charger cable. These lamps are certified by Global Lightning and enlisted in the GIZ program. At the beginning of this project, schools of the selected Upazilas were selected by Education Officers of respective Upazilas under the guidance of UNOs. And the students were selected by the school management committees. In every Upazila, an inauguration ceremony and union-wise light distribution programs were held. Bangladesh Bondhu Foundation (BONDHU) distributed the lamp sets among the students. The representatives of BCCT, Upazila Parishad, UNOs and Education Officers were present at the distribution events. During the distribution, training on the proper use of lamp sets was given to the students. Among all the programs, the inauguration programs in Bhandaria and Charfassion are mentionable. Honorable Minister Anwar Hossain Manju was present in Bhandaria and Honorable Deputy Minister Abdullah Al Islam Jacob was present in Charfassion. All the works of the project including lamp distribution were concluded on 14th August 2018. </p>
